This repository contains the code framework of my bachelor thesis in which I analytically validated the correct functioning of gamma-ray detection in the open-source neutron and photon transport simulation code OpenMC (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645491400379X?via%3Dihub).
Our group (Nuclear Disarmament Verification, Prof. Malte GÃ¶ttsche, RWTH Aachen) added the gamma functionality to OpenMC as published in (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149197024001367). This sub-project ensured the correct functioning within the framework of a simplified physical model, leading to a finite number of possible particle tracks in a specified detector volume. The particle tracks were stacked in probability trees which then recursively can be read out. As a final result, the probabilities of different deposited energies are computed and discretly plotted.
